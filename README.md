# Ming3D
Game engine.

This is a playground for me to learn different things.

Currently working on rendering.


# Renderer

Has support for:
- Rendering with OpenGL or DirectX11
- Cross platform shaders, that are automatically converted to GLSL or HLSL (still missing some features)
- Abstractions for: Textures, Vertex Buffers, Shaders, Uniforms / Constant Buffers
